The last supper is a mural painting painted from 1495 to 1498 on the back wall of the dining hall at the Dominican convent of Sta Maria delle Grazie in Italy.

The evening before Christ was betrayed by one of his disciples, he gathered them together to eat, tell them he knew what was coming and wash their feet (a gesture symbolizing that all were equal under the eyes of the Lord).
