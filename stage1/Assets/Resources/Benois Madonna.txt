During the very early years of his output Leonardo favoured the subject of the Madonna and Child. He produced several paintings on this theme along with a number of sketches and a large number of drawings. His works showed mother and child in precious private moments and focused on the emotions between them; it was Leonardo's aim that the subjects looked natural. The complexity and detail of these paintings set new standards, yet they are lesser known than his other works.
